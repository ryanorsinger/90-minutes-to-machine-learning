    "# 90 Minutes To Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are we here?\n",
    "1. Intro to the Codeup experience\n",
    "2. Big Picture overview of Data Science\n",
    "3. Intro to Machine Learning concepts and tools including:\n",
    "    - Data acquisition and preparation\n",
    "    - Data visualization\n",
    "        - \n",
    "    - Building a predictive model w/ Scikit-Learn\n",
    "    - Evaluating how well a predictive model performs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Codeup?\n",
    "- Focus on student outcomes\n",
    "- Placement services and quality of network\n",
    "- Immersion works. Full-time, live instruction for 5 months works.\n",
    "- Projects simulate the work environment from real world data to presenting findings to stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Data Science?\n",
    "- Interdisciplinary applied science intersecting programming, statistics, and domain expertise\n",
    "- The application of the scientific method of hypothesis -> experiment -> analyze -> repeat to analyze and infer outcomes from data.\n",
    "- A broad description of approaches ranging from business analysis and visualizations to machine learning and deep neural network analysis.\n",

    "## How Does Data Science Relate to Traditional Software and Data Analysis?\n",
    "![](data_science_venn_diagram_with_overlapping_disciplines.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "- Machine Learning is the process of using previous data as the fuel for determining rules for making predictions of outcomes from future data.\n",
    "-  Classical programming takes business rules and data to produce answers. Ex. TurboTax software.\n",
    "- Machine learning takes in data (and sometimes answers/labels for some data) and produces rules or predictions for future data. The example here is text message autocomplete.\n",

    "## Where does Machine Learning Fit Into Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "![example data science pipepine and product](example_data_science_project.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges of Machine Learning\n",
    "- Garbage in, garbage out\n",
    "- Insufficient quantity of data\n",
    "- Nonrepresentative data\n",
    "- Poor quality data\n",
    "- Overfitting or underfitting\n",
    "- Bias in, Bias out:\n",
    "    - [Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) arise from being human.\n",
    "    - [Statistical Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics)) arise from our methodologies.\n",
    "- Whatever Machine Learning \"learns\", it will keep doing. There is no cognition or intelligence, only pattern recognition and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What kinds of questions can Data Science methods answer?\n",
    "- How Many or How Much of something (Regression)\n",
    "- Is this observation A or B, or C or D or E... (Classification)\n",
    "- What groupings exist in the data already (Clustering)\n",
    "- What should we expect to happen next? (Time Series Analysis)\n",
    "- Is this weird? (Anomaly Detection)\n",

    "## Types of Machine Learning and Other Skills Covered in Codeup\n",
    "![machine learning methods taught at Codeup](machine_learning_methods.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What kind of ML will we doing today?\n",
    "- We'll be using a decision tree classifier to predict whether or not we should expect employees to quit a company.\n",
    "- Classification machine learning is used all the time for such things as:\n",
    "    - Facial recognition\n",
    "    - Handwriting recognition and conversion to typed text\n",
    "    - Recommendation engines\n",
    "- Classification is a \"supervised learning\" type of machine learning. That means we train the algorithm on existing data to learn a rule, a recognized pattern, to apply to future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does a decision tree work:\n",
    "- Decision Trees work like playing 20 questions. \n",
    "- Classification algorithms use training data to measure the distance between points or the distance around boundaries between points.\n",
    "- By \"learning\" the pattern recognition around sets of points, the classifier produces a \"decision rule\" to use to apply to classify new incoming data.\n",

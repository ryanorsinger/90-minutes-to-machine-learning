# 90 Minutes to Machine Learning

## What?
90 Minutes to Machine Learning is a concise introduction to the Codeup Data Science program and a deeper dive into an end-to-end machine learning project.

## So What?
Because data science is multi-disciplinary and machine learning can have a lot of depth, this introduction encapsulates all the high points as briefly as possible, focusing on answering business questions, exploratory data analysis, and an introduction to machine learning classification modeling.

    "\n",
    "## Why are we here?\n",
    "1. Intro to the Codeup experience\n",
    "2. Big Picture overview of Data Science\n",
    "3. Intro to Machine Learning concepts and tools including:\n",
    "    - Exposure to Python\n",
    "    - Data acquisition and preparation\n",
    "    - Data visualization\n",
    "    - Building a predictive model w/ Scikit-Learn\n",
    "    - Evaluating how well a predictive model performs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Codeup?\n",
    "- Focus on student outcomes\n",
    "- Placement services and quality of network\n",
    "- Immersion works. Full-time, live instruction for 5 months works.\n",
    "- Projects simulate the work environment from real world data to presenting findings to stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Data Science?\n",
    "- Interdisciplinary applied science intersecting programming, statistics, and domain expertise\n",
    "- The application of the scientific method of hypothesis -> experiment -> analyze -> repeat to analyze and infer outcomes from data.\n",
    "- A broad description of approaches ranging from business analysis and visualizations to machine learning and deep neural network analysis.\n",

    "![](data_science_venn_diagram_with_overlapping_disciplines.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "- Machine Learning is the process of using previous data as the fuel for determining rules for making predictions of outcomes from future data.\n",
    "- Classical programming takes business rules and data to produce answers. Ex. TurboTax software.\n",
    "- Machine learning takes in data (and sometimes answers/labels for some data) and produces rules or predictions for future data. The example here is text message autocomplete.\n",

    "## Where does Machine Learning Fit Into Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "![example data science pipepine and product](example_data_science_project.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges of Machine Learning\n",
    "- Poor quality data\n",
    "- Insufficient quantity of data\n",
    "- Nonrepresentative data\n",
    "- Bias in, Bias out:\n",
    "    - [Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) arise from being human.\n",
    "    - [Statistical Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics)) arise from our methodologies. These have to do with how data is collected, how people respond, etc...\n",
    "- Whatever Machine Learning \"learns\", it will keep doing. There is no cognition or intelligence, only pattern recognition and optimization.\n",

    "## What Machine Learning and other skills are in the Codeup Data Science program?\n",
    "\n",
    "![machine learning methods taught at Codeup](machine_learning_methods.png)\n",

    "## What kind of ML will we doing today?\n",
    "- We'll be using a decision tree classifier to predict whether or not we should expect employees to quit a company.\n",
    "- Classification machine learning is used all the time for such things as:\n",
    "    - Facial recognition\n",
    "    - Handwriting recognition and conversion to typed text\n",
    "    - Recommendation engines for new music or movies \n",
    "- Classification is a \"supervised learning\" type of machine learning. That means we train the algorithm on existing data to learn a rule, a recognized pattern, to apply to future data."

    "_The Human Resources department needs your help. We know that employee attrition is expensive. It's bad for culture, and it costs a lot of time and money to recruit, hire, and onboard new employees. Here is a spreadsheet export of some of our HR information we have on employees. We need you to determine the predictors of an employee staying or leaving. What are the best predictors of attrition? Are the employee survey responses good indicators if people leave?_\n",

    "- Overall goal: Predict if a particular employee is going to leave the organization.\n",
    "- Once we acquire the data, we'll need to clean/prepare it as much as necessary.\n",
    "- Define the target variable\n",
    "- Split the data to have in-sample and out-of-sample data for our modeling.\n",

    "- A data dictionary explains the columns in a dataset and what the values in those columns mean. \n",
    "- In this dataset, here's what things mean:\n",
    "    - `Attrition` specifies if an employee is left the company last year or is still employed.\n",
    "    - `MonthlyIncome` is that employee's monthly salary figure.\n",
    "    - `Education` is a number value meaning the academic background of the employee: \n",
    "        1. No college\n",
    "        2. Some college\n",
    "        3. Bachelor degree\n",
    "        4. Master's degree\n",
    "        5. PhD level\n",
    "    - `WorkLifeBalance` is a number value the employee reported on a company survey meaning:\n",
    "        1. \"Bad\"\n",
    "        2. \"Good\"\n",
    "        3. \"Better\"\n",

    "        3. \"High\"\n",
